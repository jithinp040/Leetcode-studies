## 1. Maximum Sum of Subarray:

- This is solved using **Kadane Algorithm** which is used for traversing and finding out maximum of a integer subarray with O(n) timing. The below link has some details on it. Though I dont think it will work for all types of data.
- A python implementation for the same problem is found in leetcode. Give it a read as well. It seemed well suited for that problem O(n). Link is below
- *Still not found O(log n) implementation*
